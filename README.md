## Teea's website

#### Welcome to my GitHub Pages website.
#### This website was created according to the instructions that were given on the *Cloud Services* course in autumn 2022 (*Oulu University of Applied Sciences* in the *Degree Programme in Information Technology, Option of Software Development*). The goal was to create a website using GitHub Pages and markdown language to create a basic static website.

###### Some random chatter to fill the website

I would have preferred to use **html** and **css** to create this website because I think I would have been able to make it nicer. I'll propably throw this website away after the evaluation and create a new one. I think GitHub Pages could work great when creating a portfolio or even a CV.

Even though I am complaining, I am glad I had to use markdown. There is a lot of things that can be done with it.
You can:
- make headings in many different sizes
- change text to **bold** or *italic* or even ***both***
- make lists ;)
1. unordered lists
2. ordered lists
- > make blockquotes
- create links to your favourite websites ( [The Useless Web](https://theuselessweb.com/ "Random website generator") )
